# nftcontract

Youtube demo and explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvbcjYTyLVM&t=604s

vite_519d7e11109ef3f8b21dadda48707dae49e0f94aa8ecd42ca5

(note that stakeforquota function is not available since it does not compile on testnet, so the contract cant stake quota for itself in the way it should, in this version.)
